I=8,24 //no. of clusters

J=5 //no. time periods

tau=0.1,0.3 //standard deviation of random cluster effect

gamma=0.1 //standard deviation of random cluster-time effect

(eta,rho) = [(0,0),(0.1,0.1)] //eta: standard deviation of random treatment effect rho: correlation between random cluster and random treatment effect

Sigma=1 // sd. of random noise

P = [0.1,0.2.....1] //proportion of candidate sets to be selected w.r.t. imbalance score(could also be understood as constraint tightness)
  
Theta = 0.25 when I = 8 0.15 when I = 24//coefficient of fixed treatment effect while testing for power

Imbalance score: B score(try vs Ctl balance), Imb(sequential balance) score, Imb2(mean balance) score

For stratified randomization:
S = 1(categorical), levels = 2 //S is the number of covariates 

For randomization using imbalance score:
Z1 ~ unif(-1,1) Z2 ~ Multinomium(1/3,1/3,1/3) Z3 ~ binom(1/2)
Omega = (1,1,2,1)
